Marketing Campaign Prediction with Random Forest Classifier
This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer will accept a future marketing campaign based on their demographic and purchasing behavior data. The analysis is based on customer data from a marketing campaign dataset (marketing_campaign.xlsx), which includes information such as income, recency of last purchase, and spending on different product categories. This analysis leverages machine learning to predict customer behavior, particularly their likelihood of accepting marketing campaigns. By training a Random Forest Classifier on historical data, we can create a model that helps target future campaigns more effectively. The hyperparameter tuning ensures that the model is optimized for best performance.

Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn based on demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing factors such as income, recency of last purchase, and other customer activity features, the model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) or not.This churn prediction model helps businesses identify customers at risk of leaving based on various behavioral and demographic factors. By leveraging machine learning, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to retain high-risk customers
